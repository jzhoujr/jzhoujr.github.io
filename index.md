## Welcome to jzhoujr Pages

These are just a collection of things that I am currently working on. Just to keep track of my code & to showcase some of my interests and skills.

### Excel Searcher

I am exploring ways to search a complex & large excel spreadsheet for certain values.

Specifically right now, I have a list of SHA256 hashes of high-risk malwares, and I need to trawl an abnormally large log file (in .csv format) to see if there are any matches to the high-risk profiles.

In the future this will be expanded to search for any value or pattern in said log file. Perhaps I should catalogue each log entry as a object and perform analytics.

Coded in Python 3.

### Windows Registry Monitoring

Ideally I'd like to traverse through all the registry entries, keys, & values to monitor for any suspicious activity and/or anomalies. 

I have not figured out if it's realistic to enumerate through every single registry entry or if I should just focus on a few high-risk areas. 

Also wondering if I should keep my code in Powershell or use Python 3.
